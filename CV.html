<h2 id="headings">Expertise</h2>

<p><em>I am a researcher of the ancient Mediterranean: trained as an Ancient Historian (PhD),  Classical Archaeologist (MA), and Classicist (MA), but I  consider myself a Digital Epigrapher - a subdiscipline that fuses all the aspects of ancient life with the cutting-edge digital research. I combine my passion for ancient Greek and Roman history with over 15 years of experience in archaeological fieldwork and a strong foundation in Digital Humanities and research software development. By leveraging computational and statistical techniques, machine learning, text mining, and social network analysis, I investigate the evolution of the ancient Meditteranean world over centuries, addressing the incomplete and biased nature of Latin and Greek epigraphic evidence. I apply the long-duree historical perspective to study how past societies changed in reaction to elevated societal pressure, such as migration, depletion of resources, conflicts, degrading ecological environment or spread of infectious diseases - all topics relevant to today’s society. 

My work is characterized by a collaborative spirit and commitment to knowledge sharing and interdisciplinary integration, adhering to the principles of FAIR data and Open Science. I help to develop and apply cutting-edge solutions to rethink traditional methodologies to enable large-scale analysis of historical sources, namely primary texts with high levels of temporal uncertainty. I strive for the highest standards of academic excellence while constantly pushing the boundaries of current research, yet I am committed to nurturing a friendly and honest environment. I maintain a worldwide network of active collaborations, both in the fields of archaeology and epigraphy.

<h2 id="headings">International Research Projects (alphabetic order)</h2>

<p><em>I have participated in over 10 international collaborative archaeological projects across Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, the Czech Republic, Israel, and Australia. My roles have included team leader, research assistant, and domain specialist in epigraphy, data collection, data management, and GIS. The projects have encompassed traditional excavation, pedestrian field surface survey, remote sensing, ground-truthing, legacy data verification, and digitization of analogue data. In the past six years, I have become involved in several Digital Archaeology (FAIMS, SDAM) and Digital Epigraphy (FAIR Epigraphy, Past Social Networks) projects, fostering interdisciplinary and international collaboration.</em></p>

<h2 id="headings">Digital skills and favourite tools</h2>
<p><em>I have a long-term interest in digital scholarship, integrating diverse methodological approaches and workflows to enhance our understanding of historical evidence. Self-taught in various programming languages, including R and Python, I employ these skills in my research, leveraging computational and statistical methods. I co-develop computational pipelines to analyze Roman society over time on both macro and micro levels, using inscriptions as empirical data. Since April 2018, I have been a member of the Carpentries community, advocating for reproducible science and teaching digital literacy to scholars and students. I enjoy challenging myself with complex tasks and experimenting with new techniques. My digital portfolio is freely accessible on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/petrifiedvoices">https://github.com/petrifiedvoices</a></em></p>

<h2 id="headings">Academic publications</h2>
<p><em>I have published  14 peer-reviewed articles in international scientific journals, eight chapters in edited volumes, and nine posters. I have actively participated in many international archaeological and epigraphic conferences, and given talks as an invited speaker around Europe and Australia. I co-organised both local and international workshops and educational activities. I have published under the last name Heřmánková (since 2019) and Janouchová (until 2019). I provide an example of my extensive digital portfolio, documenting not only the range of my research but also the successful incorporation of digital methods into the discipline considered very traditional, epigraphy and namely ancient history. I have experience with data creation: I published an editio princeps (a primary publication of inscriptions) in its traditional and digital format but also aggregated digital archives from various sources. I have created several tools making the work of a historian not only easier but also compliant with the state of the art requirements of the discipline. I helped to develop methods that push the boundaries of the discipline while adhering to academic rigour. The usefulness of my approach can be demonstrated by not only the list of academic publications but also by other people using the tools and methods in their research. </em></p>

<h2 id="headings">Teaching Experience</h2>
<p><em>I have experience teaching courses in ancient Greek history, ancient Greek language and digital humanities / digital history. I enjoy working with students and helping other researchers expand their horizons and find new ways of understanding historical material. My teaching style is accommodating, inclusive and open to feedback, yet I try to incorporate my research into the teaching material so the students get real-life experience and understand the relevance of history in modern society. My specialty is working with primary texts in low-resourced languages, such as ancient Greek or Latin.
As part of my postdoc at Aarhus Unversity, I assisted in teaching Digital Methods for BA History students 2019-2021 following the Carpentries curriculum, as well as co-instructed and acted as a helper for several Data and Software Carpentries organised by the Centre for Digital History (CEDHAR). I am an active member of The Carpentries community, which promotes digital methods and digital research literacy worldwide. I convened and taught a class in advanced Ancient Greek at Macquarie University in 2018. I supervised several interns at Macquarie and Aarhus University. While doing my PhD, I tutored courses on ancient Greek History, taught English and Czech in a private language school and overlooked an intern program at several projects. In the spring of 2025, I will be teaching an introduction to Digital Epigraphy “From Stone to Computer: A Practical Dive into Digital Epigraphy” to MA students of archaeology/classics at Aarhus University. At the same time, I will participate in the University Pedagogical Programme at Aarhus University to receive my qualification.</em></p>

<h2 id="headings">Scholarships &amp; Special training</h2>
<p><em> I am committed to continuous skill improvement, seeking specialized training and self-directed learning through online workshops and tutorials. This effort was particularly intensified during the two years of lockdowns and cancellation of in-person activities. I have undertaken targeted training in programming, language acquisition, digital and traditional epigraphy, and GIS. I have also received several international scholarships, enabling me to enhance my skills and study in Greece, Bulgaria, and Australia.
